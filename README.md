# Overview

This is a simple time-tracker application that keeps track of time spent on projects and allows exporting this data into `xlsx`.

Data is stored using your browser's local storage and is designed to persist across sessions. As a result, **if you clear your browser's local storage data, the timesheet data will also be cleared.**
